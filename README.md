# Credit-Risk-Probability-Model-using-Alternative-Data
End-to-end credit risk modeling using alternative eCommerce transaction data. The project builds a proxy default signal from customer behavior, trains probability-of-default models, converts risk into credit scores, and deploys predictions via a FastAPI service with MLOps, testing, and CI/CD.
